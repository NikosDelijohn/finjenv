These two circuits correspond to Circuit A and Circuit B of the IEEE ACCESS journal paper entitled
"A Reliability Evaluation Flow for Assessing the Impact of Permanent Hardware Faults on Integer Arithmetic Circuits".
Due to the circuits' RTL being proprietary, we are only able to provide the corresponding gate-level netlists.
